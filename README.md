### :test_tube: Testing
- On our [testing instructions](https://www.mercadopago.com.br/developers/en/guides/online-payments/checkout-api/testing) you'll find a guide on how to create **[test users](https://www.mercadopago.com.br/developers/en/guides/online-payments/checkout-api/testing#bookmark_how_to_create_users)**.
- You have to [create a Pix key](https://www.mercadopago.com.br/stop/pix) in the seller's account in Mercado Pago (remember you can create and use a test user as a seller).
- **IMPORTANT:** there are some limitations when testing this payment method with test users. When creating a payment, it will be pending and the corresponding Pix code and QR code will be returned, but it will not be possible to use these codes to end the flow and approve the test payment.
